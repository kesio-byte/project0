Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
My website is about a meat shop, it is a family business and we are the owners
and the workers.
This website has five pages :
First page is my home page where everything is happening as the main app page.
It has the navigation bar, on the navbar there is contacts, about us, YouTube Video
and plans menu.
On contacts is all about how you can get us.
On about us it is about knowing our members and how to get them.
On YouTube it where you can get my screen cast about my app.
On plans is our daily weekly and monthly offers to our dear costumers.
I have put a link connecting my four pages:
Login form, register form, checkout form and lastly Chiko's Art Gallery for Our
customers to relax there brains.
Thank you.
